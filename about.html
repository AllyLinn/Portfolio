        <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Ally,</strong> and I am going to be a junior in the fall. <br> 
            I live in Deerfield, Illinois which is a suburb 45 minutes outside of Chicago.</p>
        <h4>In My Free Time</h4>
        <p>My favorite sport to play is soccer, and I play it all throughout the year. 
            During the fall and winter, I play on a travel club team, and I play for my high school in the spring. 
            I have been playing soocer since I was three years old! <br> 
            In my free time, I also play tennis with my friends at the park.</p>

        <h4>Summer</h4>
        <p>Over the summer, I go to overnight camp in Wisconsin. 
            I have been going for the past 8 summers, however it was cancelled this year because of the coronavirus. 
            At camp, my favorite activities are tubing and skiing!!</p>
