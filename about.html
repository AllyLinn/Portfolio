        <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Ally,</strong> and I am going to be a junior in the fall.</p>
        <p>I live in Deerfield, Illinois which is a suburb 45 minutes outside of Chicago.</p>
        <h4>In My Free Time</h4>
        <p>My favorite sport to play is soccer, and I play it all throughout the year. During the fall and winter, I play on a travel club team, and I play for my high school in the spring. It is my favorite sport, and I have been playing ever since I was little. <br>In my free time, I also play tennis with my friends.</p>
        <h4>Summer</h4>
        <p>Over the summer, I go to overnight camp in Wisconsin. I have been going for the past 8 summers, however it was cancelled this year because of Covid-19. At camp, my favorite activity is tubing, and I also enjoy running and kickboxing.</p>
