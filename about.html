            <h3>In My Free Time</h3>
        <p>
            My favorite sport to play is soccer, and I play it all throughout the year. 
            During the fall and winter, I play on a travel club team, and I play for my high school in the spring. 
            I have been playing soocer since I was three years old! I also watch European soccer games on TV 
            with my dad!

            <h3>Summer</h3>
        <p>
            Over the summer, I go to overnight camp in Wisconsin. 
            I have been going for the past 8 summers, however it was cancelled this year because of the coronavirus. 
            At camp, my favorite activities are tubing and skiing!!
